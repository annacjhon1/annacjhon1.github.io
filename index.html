Marie Chouinard <h1>Marie Chouinard</h1>

<div class = "middletext"> Marie Chouinard was a Canadian performer/ choreographer who is now in her late 60's. She was in the dance industry for 12 years. She had shown her first choreographed piece ,"Crystallization" in 1978. After 12 years as a solo performer and choreographer, Marie Chouinard founded her own company in 1990. 

She was very disinterested with the distinctions between the female and male genders. She is, characteristically, anti the stereotypical assumptions (and images) which are projected onto ‘gendered’ bodies.
 The reason that she was one of the feminist in the dance comunity is because she was able to change the very constructs and open dance up to a new perspective. She was able to showcase this through her works and showed that the clear  distinctions between genders were meaningless. She identified herself as a non-binary. When approaching dance, she ignored the stereotypes for women in dance. 

In general, Marie for most of her choreographed solos and pieces went outside the expectations for female gender and set out to  break the gender norms placed for women and men in the dance industry.
